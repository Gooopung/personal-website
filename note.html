    <h1># NOTE</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="text">In ancient Chinese customs, when a building was completed, a stone tablet would be placed nearby, inscribed with the process of constructing the building and the stories associated with it. So, I'm following this ancient tradition to write a "monument" for my website.</span><br><br>
      <span class="text" id="highlight"><strong>Reading is his passion, but he doesn’t delve into the nitty-gritty of underlying meanings.  Each time he comprehends something, he would be so thrilled that he forgets to eat.</strong></span><br><br>
      <span class="text">This is a quote by Tao Yuanming, which I'll temporarily use for self-praise. My personality is quite unique. I'm interested in all kinds of unfamiliar fields and invest my efforts in learning about them. This sometimes leads me to forget to eat. My interests include, but are not limited to, mysticism, literature, history, religion, the I Ching, divination, Bazi, as well as programming languages like R, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, and more. My hobbies and skills are hard to confine to a single field, but the downside is that I can't specialize in one area. Whether it's the religious field, which I've been engaged with for a long time, or the programming field I've recently started, I feel I'm far from earning the title of an "expert." But the upside is that my perspective is broader than most. Because I don't think there are many wizard programmers - it's a joke.</span><br><br>
      <span class="text">During my college years, I subconsciously developed a resistance to programming after encountering R Studio. I thought it was too difficult, something I couldn't learn, so I didn't pursue it further. However, reality has shown that this mindset was the first obstacle blocking my progress. Fortunately, I met Mr. Liang, who helped me enter the world of programming and find my future learning direction. Consequently, I began to methodically learn R, Python, and database languages, and later ventured into HTML, CSS, and more, resulting in the creation of this website today.</span><br><br>
      <span class="text">One cannot stop learning, nor should they give up due to difficulties. I remember the words of prof. Kim: "Our goal is to nurture talents that society as a whole needs, not just train employees for a single company." Every piece of knowledge we acquire has the potential to be a driving force for change in society, and will be of great use in the future.</span>
